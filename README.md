# Segment-Customer-Base
Develop a customer segmentation that marketing teams can use on a routine basis for their communication campaigns.

To better understand the needs of the project:

Olist marketing teams need an actionable description of the segmentation that allows them to thoroughly grasp its underlying logic (Notebook format).
The database contains information such as order history, products purchased, customer satisfaction comments, and location.
The quality of the data is somewhat poor. The idea is to create the best possible features for making optimum use of them.
Customer segmentation means understand the different types of users. Unsupervised algorithm is probably the best to use. 
The segmentation needs to be robust: adding a few new customers to the database and creating a new segmentation using the same model should not result in totally different conclusions.
